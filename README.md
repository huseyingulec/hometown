# Hometown

Live-demo ->   https://hometown-izmir.netlify.app/

## What I've done;
In this project, I have built my hometown website. I have tried to use classes, flexbox, background image, a color palette. I pushed myself to add new section and I have added see more buttons to the activity sections. I have tried to customize the website as much as possible to challenge myself. It was fun to learn something new along the way.
